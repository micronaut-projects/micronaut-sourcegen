To use a builder pattern with types that are using inheritance you annotate a Java bean with `@SuperBuilder`:

[source,java]
----
include::test-suite-java/src/main/java/io/micronaut/sourcegen/example/Animal.java[tags=clazz,indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::test-suite-java/src/main/java/io/micronaut/sourcegen/example/Cat.java[tags=clazz,indent=0]
----

[source,java]
----
include::test-suite-java/src/main/java/io/micronaut/sourcegen/example/Dog.java[tags=clazz,indent=0]
----

For every class annotated with `@SuperBuilder` there going to be two builders generated at compilation-time, an abstract one intended to be inherited and second one to constructor the bean.

In the previous example five classes are generated:

- `AbstractAnimalSuperBuilder`
- `AbstractCatSuperBuilder`
- `CatSuperBuilder`
- `AbstractDogSuperBuilder`
- `DogSuperBuilder`

NOTE: `@SuperBuilder` requires every super-class to be annotated with `@SuperBuilder`

You can use a builder to create an instance:
