If you annotate a Java Bean with `@ToString`, a `[Bean]Object` class is generated at compilation-time
with a static implementation of the java.utils.Object's toString() method.

- Properties that do not wish to be printed out should be annotated with @ToString.Exclude
- All bean properties (with getters) will be written in the form of a Java Record in the generated toString() method with signature:

    `public static String [BeanName]Object.toString(BeanName object)`

NOTE: The user is expected to use the generated static method by overriding the toString() method themselves.
